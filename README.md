<h3>Tutorial:</h3>

  1 - Open Webstorm's settings\
  2 - Test the git.exe file by connecting it to webstorm (Version Control)\
  3 - Using the VCS tab, create a git repository from import into version control to create a local repository\
	4 - Click "Commit" in the VCS tab or the checkmark in the top right corner of Webstorm\
	5 - Remeber to add a comment to each commit of any changes made in your files!\
	6 - Using the Import Into tab, enter your GitHub username & password and share the project on github\
	7 - Double check that the project has been created on GitHub's site and that the name matches what you created through Webstorm\
	8 - Any future changes just need to be committed and then pushed to the repository on GitHub

<h3>Definitions:</h3>

<b>GIT</b> - an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating 
system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.\
<b>GITHUB</b> -  provide a service to an entire organization and use their own identity when performing their function. They 
can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with 
granular permissions and built-in webhooks.\
<b>Repository</b> -  is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository 
contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can 
have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.\
<b>Clone</b> - a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the 
act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep 
track of your changes without having to be online.\
<b>Commit</b> - or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save 
your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes 
commited along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what
changes were made.\
<b>Push</b> - to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, 
you can push those changes so that others may access them.\
<b>Pull</b> - when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both 
working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.\
<b>Branch</b> - a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or 
master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, 
you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.\
<b>Merge</b> -  takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This 
often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line.\
<b>Merge Conflict</b> - A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different 
changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge 
conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.\
<b>Fetch</b> - adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Fetching allows 
you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.\
<b>Remote</b> - the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be 
connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.
